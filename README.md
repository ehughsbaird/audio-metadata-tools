# Audio Metadata Tools

Various little python tools I've created and used to manage audio files. Most of them use the
python library [mutagen](https://mutagen.readthedocs.io/en/latest/), and so are licensed under
[GPL 2](./LICENSE).

Usage instructions and descriptions of the tools are described some in the header comment of the
tools themselves.

The tool to "fix" filenames is not purely relevant to audio applications, that's just the reason
that I created it.
